# Automated-futures-pnl-tracker
This repository hosts an Automated Position and P&L Management System for futures trading. It provides essential tools for traders, including a Live Dashboard for real-time tracking of open positions and running P/L, a detailed Fill Book (trade log), and Trade History for comprehensive performance review. The system also includes Mapping/Reference sheets for contract specifications, commission, and tick values. Its primary goal is to facilitate data-driven trading decisions and ensure accurate, real-time monitoring of market risk and exposure, originally developed for use in a professional trading environment like Futures First.
